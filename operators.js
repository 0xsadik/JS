                     [+] Types of javaScript operators

                     There are different types of javaScript operators:

                     - Arthmetic operators:
                            +       addition
                            -       subtraction
                            *       multiplication
                            **      exponentiation
                            /       division
                            %       modulus (division remainder)
                            ++      increment
                            --      decrement
                        
                        - Assignment operatos:
                            =       x = y
                            +=      x += y
                            -=      x -= y
                            *=      x *= y
                            /=      x / y
                            %=      x % y
                            **=     x **= y

                        - Comparison Operators:

                            ==      equal to
                            ===     equal value and equal type
                            !=      not equal
                            !==     not equal value or not equal type
                            >       greater than
                            <       less than
                            >=      greater than or equal to
                            <=      less than or equal to
                            ?       ternary operator


                        - Logical operators:
                            &&      logical and
                            ||      logical or
                            !       logical not

                        
                        - Type operators:
                            typeof          returns the type of a variable
                            instanceof      returns true if an object is an instance of an object type
                        

                        - Bitwise Operators
                            - bit operators work on 32bits number;

                            &           AND
                            |           OR
                            ~           NOT
                            ^           XOR
                            <<          left shift
                            >>          right shift
                            >>>         unsigned right shift
