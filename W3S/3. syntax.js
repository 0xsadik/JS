/* 

        JavaScript Values:

        the javascript syntax defines two types of values:
                - Fixed values
                - Variable values
            
            Fixed values are called ' literals'
            variable values are called ' Variables ' 

*/


/*

        --> js  literals <--
            Numbers are written with or without decimals:

                10.50   // with decimal 
                1001    // without decimal (it's binary which decimal value is = 9)

            Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:
                "Shakil babu"
                'Fahim morshed'

/*

            JavaScript Variables

            in a programming language, varibales are used to store data values.

            javascript uses the keywords (var, let, const) to declare varibales.

            let x; --> where, let is a keyword and x is variable
            x = 6; --> where, x is assigned (with '=' assignment operator) the value 6



            JavaScript Operators:

            javaScript uses 'arthmetic operators (+, -, *, /) to compute values

            (10 + 20) * 5; 



            JavaScript Expressions:

            An expression is a combination of values, variables and operators

            5 * 10
            a * 5


            All javascript identifires are 'case sensitive'
            The vaiable 'LastName' and 'lastname' are two different variables
