/* 
        Most javaScript programs contain many javaScript statements.
        The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.


        Semicolons;

        semicolons separate javascript statements.
        when separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:
        a = 12; b = 10; c = a + b; (multiple statements)


        JavaScript white space:

        javaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.
        -> a good practice is to put spaces around operators (+ - = / )
