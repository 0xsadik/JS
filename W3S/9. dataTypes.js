                [+] JavaScript Data Types 

                javaScript vairables can hold different data types: numbes, string, objects and more:

                let length = 12;                                // numeber
                let lastName = "william";                       // string
                let x = {firstName: "john", lastName: "Doe"};   // object



                The concept of Data types:

                - to be able to operate on variables it is important to know something about the type

                
                JavaScript types are dynamic

                javascript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types 

                let x;              // x is undefined 
                x = 5;              // x is a number 
                x = "john"          // x is a string 




                javaScript String:

                a string is a series of characters like "fahim shakil"
                string are written with quotes. we can use single or double quotes

                let friend1 = "Shakil babu";        // using double quotes
                let friend2 = 'Fahim morshed'       // using single quotes

                single quotes inside double quotes:

                let str = "his nick name is 'wolf' ";





                javaScript Numbers
                
                javascript has only one type of numbers
                numbers can be written with, or without decimals

                let x1 = 34.00;
                let x2 = 34;



                // extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notation:

                let y = 123e5;          // 12300000
                let x = 123e-5          // 0.00123






                javaScript Booleans

                booleans can only have two values:
                                - true
                                - false

                let x = 5;
                let y = 5;
                let z = 6;

                (x == y)        // ture
                (x == z)        // false




                javaScript arrays:

                javascript arrays are written with square brackets
                array items are separated by commas

                const cars = ['saab', 'vlovlo', 'BMW'];






                javaScript Objects 

                javascript objects are written with curly braces {}
                object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas;

                const person = {firstname: 'shakil', lastname:'babu', age: 22, eyecolor: 'black'};
